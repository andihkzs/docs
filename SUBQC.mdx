To edit the sidebar in Mintlify, you need to update the `docs.json` file, which configures the navigation menu. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Update **`docs.json`: The `docs.json` file defines the structure of your sidebar. You need to specify the pages and their hierarchy within this file. For example, you can create nested navigation groups by organizing your pages under different tabs and groups[**<sup>12</sup>**](https://starter.mintlify.com/essentials/navigation).
2. **Add Metadata to MDX Files**: Each page in your documentation is an MDX file. To customize how these pages appear in the sidebar, you can add metadata at the top of each MDX file. For instance, you can set a different title for the sidebar using the `sidebarTitle` attribute, or add an icon using the `icon` attribute[**<sup>34</sup>**](https://mintlify.com/docs/page).
3. **Customize Styling**: You can further customize the styling of components within the sidebar by modifying the `docs.json` file. This includes setting colors, logos, and other configurations[**<sup>5</sup>**](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/global)[**<sup>6</sup>**](https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/custom/css).
4. **Commit and Push Changes**: After making the necessary changes to your `docs.json` file and MDX files, commit and push your changes to update your documentation site[**<sup>76</sup>**](https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/custom/css).

By following these steps, you can effectively edit and customize the sidebar in your Mintlify documentation.
